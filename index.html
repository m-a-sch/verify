        <p>Hi there, if you'd like to be verified on Mastodon, i.e. have your metadata shown in green like in the picture above
            and you do not own a website or you own one which is maintained 
        through a "no-code content management system" which does not allow you to include HTML tags, here is what you can do: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>let me know that you want to be verified using some presence that you already have on the web. This can be a facebook, linkedin, 
            twitter account, whatever. Just send me a DM @m_a_schenk@tooting.ch
            <li>I'll create a page on <code>m-a-sch.github.io/verify</code> which will include your mastodon
                handle and redirect people to your chosen verified account.
            <li>In your profile, you'll include a meta-data which will look like this, e.g. 
                <code>Twitter, htttps://m-a-sch.github.io/verify/@your handle@your instance.html</code>
        </ul>
    </body>
