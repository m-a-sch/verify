        <p>Hi there, if you'd like to be verified on Mastodon and you do not own a website or own one which is maintained by someone else or 
        through a "no-code content management system, here is what you can do: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>let me know that you want to be verified using some presence that you already have on the web. This can be a facebook, linkedin, 
            twitter account, whatever. Just send me a DM @m_a_schenk@tooting.ch
            <li>I'll create a page on m-a-sch.github.io/verify which will include you mastodon handle and redirect people to your chosen verified account.
            <li>In your profile, you'll include a meta-data which will look like this, e.g. 
                <code>Twitter, htttps://m-a-sch.github.io/verify/@<your handle>@<your instance.html</code>
        </ul>
    </body>
